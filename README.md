# Sails Ãœberlord

## a Sails application

This is a remake of the *activityOverlord* app, as demonstrated in *Sailscasts* by _Irl Nathan_

This version of the app will make the following changes and additions:

* Coffeescript replaces Javascript
* Jade templates replaces EJS templates
* AngularJS integration for a SPA
* BaconJS to handle Event streams
  - server side (Socket.IO and Ajax)
  - client side (better two-way binding via Bacon Properties)

Inspired by (and mixing ideas from):
